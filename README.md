#Projects Built Using C Programming Language!

Description:
I have created this small project while learning C programming language in my first year of college. 
There is a simple bank management project which can perform actions like deposit, withdrawal, transfer and checking account details. 
And additionally built a simple calculator which can perform all basic functionality to solve certain problems.

Things Learned During This Project:
Bank Management System: This is a menu driven project which includes learning about calling different functions, passing through many loops, use of multiple switch cases and some concepts of C Programming.
Simple Calculator: This is a beginner level project which includes uses of concepts like calling of functions, checking conditional statements and uses of various switch cases.
